# Practical 1:

## Markdown:  
A lightweight markup language with a plain text formatting syntax. Designed so that conversion to HTML is possible and other formats using a tool. 

## Key Rules: 
Two underscores/* means that the enclosed text becomes bold. 
One underscore/* means that the enclosed text becomes italic. 
Two ~ means that the text has a strikethrough. 
Lists can be made by typing numbers followed by a dot and a space. 
Three spaces can be used to indent a paragraph. 
[Anchor Text](Link "Title") 
# = H1, ## = H2 etc. 
Reference Style Image: ![alt text] [logo] [logo]: link "title" 
`Inline Code` 
 > Creates a block quote 
Three of more ---, ***, ___ creates a solid horizontal line.

## Hack Into A Robot: 

The robot was networked and we were given an IP address. 
We win!


# Practical 2: 
## DC Motor: 

This task consisted of constructing a very basic DC motor.

## In Motion:

## Basic Motor Design: 

We created a simple yet effective DC motor using a cork as a commutator and armature in one.

## Taking It Further: 

Having produced a working DC motor using a single coil, we decided to try and produce one using 4 coils. We 3D printed mounting and attached it to a larger piece of plywood. In order to make this motor turn faster, we used thicker gauge copper wire in order to take a higher current and more windings. We also stacked up far more magnets.

## Commutator construction: 

Using two pieces of copper tape and a 3D printed commutator, we produced a fairly efficient commutator. 

## Armature winding: 

We used far more turns in the copper wire this time, and made sure the windings were tightly wound. 


# Practical 3:  
## Incremental Encoder:

## 3D Printing And Mounting: 

We 3D printed a disk with a slot in it. This would attach to the motor shaft and spin. An LED light source and phototransistor detector would then detect each rotation as a signal is picked up when the slot is between the LED and detector.
